# create an empty dictionary named "zeldaItems"

# open file here:

# read in a line and create a list
# hint - just look for lines that start with "@"
# hint - you will want to split on ":" and then get the word or words before it to make the item word... for example you have "@ Letter : some description" where you want to get the word "Letter" added as a "key" to your dictionary.  You also have "@ Monster Bait : some description" where you want to add "MosterBait" to your dictionary... so you will need to do some string manipulation and work to get the items into your dictionary...

# Create a dictionary of keys using the words from your list
